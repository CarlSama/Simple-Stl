## Introduction

This is stl implementation based on sgi version.

Free to copy and modified.

Some to say :
	1) Only use built-in class Allocator to manage memory, so it's by now un-able to appoint third-party allocator for container here.

	2) I gradually change file name from ss-xxx.h to xxx.h. The type of ss-xxx.h was learn from sgi stl, but I strongly prefer xxx.h, which seems like common stl header files but with ".h".
